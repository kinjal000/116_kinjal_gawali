              <p>Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam was a famous Indian scientist and the 11th President of India.<br>
                He is known as the "Missile Man of India" because of his work in space and defense projects.<br>
                I admire him because he was very humble, hardworking, and always motivated students to dream big.<br>
                His life teaches us that with dedication and honesty, anything is possible.</p>
